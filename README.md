Team 815 Website

How to open:
-If everything works correctly you should just be able
to open Team815.html.

More info:
-Hmtl code for the index (home page) is located in Team815.html,
it should act as a working file to view while being editable in
something like visual studio code.
-Other essential files are in the Sub and StyleSheets file,
(Do not change the file names, this will break the code.)
